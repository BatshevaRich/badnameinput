# Bad name input site

## Why?
No reason. I made this because I was bored out of my mind, and I was inspired by the all the glorious UI in [here](https://reddit.com/r/badUIbattles).

## Features
* Amazing security anti key loggers (1000% tested, I assure you). You must choose your name, using the select input.
* The select input is randomly generated everytime you:
    * refresh the page.
    * delete a character.
    * reset the input.
* You CANNOT use inspect element to change the attributes. The app will try to correct this and will show an error message.
* According to [proffessional standards](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), this is a good website.
